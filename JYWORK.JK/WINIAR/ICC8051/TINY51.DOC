	Created: 20/Dec/92	IANB
	Revised:


	The source files for the TINY51 may differ sometimes compared
	to the description in the manual. The functionallity has not
	changed, we have just optimised the code a bit.

	Note that EXMPL1.C and EXMPL2.C are the only examples you can run
	in the C-SPY simulator. The other examples need the timer function
	which is not supported by the C-SPY simulator.
