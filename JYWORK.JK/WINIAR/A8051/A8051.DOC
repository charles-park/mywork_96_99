		   ========================

Created: 940922 [IMAF]

Dear User;

This file contains important information which is not available in the current
manual.  PLEASE READ IT (as this may save you a lot of time)!

This release of the A8051 cross assembler is upwardly compatible with previous
versions.  

		Version 2.00 - 2.02 changes

The enhancements are entirely devoted to support the 4.00 version
and above of IAR's 8051 C compiler.  The added directives are therefore only
specified in the 8051 C manual.

Other changes:  The MS-DOS version now has a symbol-table capability in excess
of 1000 symbols on a machine with 512K user RAM.

		Version 2.03 changes

AJMP and ACALL can now be used in relocatable segments. Note that if the 
AJMP/ACALL is not in the same page as the label, error 18 "Range error" will
be produced from the linker, telling the file, module, and the relative place
in the segment.

AJMP, ACALL, and short jumps can now jump to an external label, SFB, or SFE.
See the error note above.

Include files for Siemens 80751/752 chip and 80552 chip is now included.
