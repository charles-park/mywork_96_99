========================
1. Important Information
========================


4.46M
	* HP-format

	  Note that the HP-format does not support source debugging or local
	  variables, due to the fact that the linker can't produce the 
	  relevant local-info files necessary for this to work in the 
	  HP-emulator.

	* C code in include file support

	  The UBROF does not support C code in include files, therefore can
	  the linker not support it either. A workaround is to use the 
	  -ri -L compiler options to include the include files into the main
	  file and produce a listing of the source into one list-file, then
	  use the produced list-file instead of the source-files when 
	  debugging in any other debugger than C-SPY.

	* X-reference listing

	  Index is deleted from the xref.	

	  The absolute segments will be printed in the module map and in the 
	  segment map when producing cross reference. 

	  The addresses for bit variables and bit segments are now displayed 
	  as byteaddress.bitnumber in the cross reference. 

	  The cross-reference map now has ove as type in the segment-map and
	  overlayable as segment-type in the  module map.


	* Command file

	  \ is a line continuation mark in command files.

	* Segment overlay flag (-z)

	  The segment overlap flag (-z) has been changed to degrade the 
	  segment overlap error to a similar warning. Note the check is always
	  done now. The segment overlap will check absolute segments against 
	  each other and against relocatable segments. This produced three 
	  errors and three new warnings about absolute segments overlapping 
	  absolute segments or relocatable segments. 

	* Formats

	  A new option flag -Y{character} exists. It will take a character to 
	  enable optional features in specific formats choosen by -F. If only
	  -Y is given, then xlink will take that as the option -Y0.

	  Error 81: "Unknown flag in cross reference option -Ymmm" is changed 
	  to "Unknown flag in extended format option -Ymmm"

	  nec78k-symb format is introduced.

	  Nec2-symbolic is a symbol format as nec-symbolic with maximum 31 
	  char symbols	and upper and lower case symbols.

	  Nec2 is a format containing nec2-symbolic and intel-standard.

	  Sysrof is a symbol format for cpu H16, H8500 and H8300. The default
	  extension to the format sysrof is .abs. If not compiled with -r, 
	  SYSROF will have types on variables (base types, pointers, arrays 
	  and functions). If compiled with -r it will additionaly have 
	  function variable info (parameters, local and static variables) and 
	  line numbers. If the variable is an assembler variable and it is not
	  referred to from any C module then the type of the variable will be
	  deduced on the type of the segment it is in:
	  	segment type	 		entry		
		------------			-----		
		absolute segment		variable/data		
		CODE				entry		
		CONST,DATA,XDATA,IDATA	variable/data	
		UNTYPED,BIT,REGISTER		variable/data	
	  The segment names will be deduced by:
	  	segment type to XLINK		segment name
		---------------------		------------
		CONST				C
		DATA,XDATA,IDATA,BIT,REGISTER	D
		UNTYPED,CODE			P
	  The equates in the DSY record cannot perhaps be handled by the ASE.
	  If so, then try the -Y0 option.

	  The format AOMF8051 can now be used with the emulator from Intel
	  ICE51FX. It has function and local variables information as well as
	  the absolute bits and SFR:s from the compiler as local variables.

	  Format for the Hitex emulator for 8051 is included, if you use the 
	  options -Faomf8051 and -Y0, with the same prestanda as the AOMF8051 
	  with added type information.

	  The formats ashling-cpu has got function information and local 
	  variables information.

	  The format AOMF8096 can now be used with the newest version of the 
	  Intel emulator for the 8096. The format has also got information
	  about functions, locals and basic types.

	  The format intel standard now always produce the end record 0100000f
	  now, even if there is an end record with program start address.
	  If our normal intel-std way of ending (if exist program entry write
	  that then write :00000001FF) does not work try:
	    	-Y or -Y0 => Always end only with :00000001FF
		-Y1       => End with program entry, if exist, else :0000001FF


	  The motorola format now produces the S8 end of file record for 
	  program entries larger than 0xffff.

  	  Pentica-a, -b, -c, -d now outputs three byte addresses for addresses
	  that are more than two bytes.

	  Pentica-a, -b, -c, -d and msd-symb formats use the -Y0 option to
	  enable all symbols to be module:symbolname instead in the formats, 
	  the -Y1 option to enable local and line symbols to be 
	  module:symbolname instead, the -Y2 option to enable line symbols
	  to be module:linenumber instead.

	  The mpds-code can now fill bytes with 0xFF instead by using the -Y0
	  option.



	* Overlayable relative segments

	  The linker now has support for overlayable relative segments. 

	  Error 82: "Conflict in segment 'name'. Mixing overlayable and not
	  overlayable segment parts".

	  Error 83: "The overlayable segment 'name' may not be banked".

	  Error 84: "The overlayable segment 'name' must be of relative type".

	  The linker now supports the omfconverter program. This means that it
	  matches PL/M-51 call-system with our C call-system. The entries is
	  linked as usual. The overlayable segments in PL/M-51 is supported.



	* DOS compatibility

	  Don't use the DOS command APPEND due to the fact that the linker
	  does not handle it correctly.

	* H8300H bits are supported properly, as well as sign of message for
	  H8300H.

	* If a comment followed immediately by an eof was in a command file 
	  the linker crashed.

4.46K		940315

	* The overlay-algorithm missed if there was a recursive system that
	  directly called another recursive system and at the same time called
	  it indirectly (via other functions).

	* Xlink now works for 80751 code together with ICC8051 V5.

4.46J		940301

	* Xlink HP format now works for H8/300H

4.46I		940228

	  the linker. The FAR segment will not allow a modules segment part to
	  be placed over a 64k boundary (then it will move the part to start 
	  at the new boundary). A new error has been made for the FAR 
	  segments, namely if a module contributes with a far segment part 
	  that is larger than 64k.

	* intel-extended can now dump banked code. And has been updated to
	  correctly follow the Intel specification. Note that the IAR XLINK
	  manual is incorrect about the intel-extended format.
	    -Y or -Y0 (default)   => Intel-extended segmented variant.
	    -Y1 and not 8086 chip => Intel-extended 32-bit linear variant.

4.43F		920526

	* H8300 has bit segment allocation now.

4.43E		920424

	* Fixed a bug for t_n(pcrel,16). It gave a range error always
	  due to a new bug in Microsoft C.

4.43D		920410

	* Fixed a bug in version 5 UBROF when loading (t_ext_p8/n8).

	* Inserted tag t_stack_error_D01 to get more info to the user for
	  t_check errors (range error, number 18)

4.43C		920327

	* Changed HP-symbolic format again (linker-names xx)

4.43B		920310

	* Changed HP-symbolic format again (linker-names l).

4.43A		920302

	* Fixed a bug in the LAN checking system for 8051. Now it let C lan 
	  models that were zero by.

	* Revised the version number. No it is built up like:

		sub-minor :== a character (A - Z)

	* Included a lot of stack tags for UBROF version 5.

4.42		920226

	* Included OKI 65000

	* Corrected a bug in the HP-format. Linker name is checked by
	  later versions of the emulators (don't know why, but they do),
	  and we had not updated our linker names for each cpu.

4.41		920221

	* Fixed a problem in the ashling-64180 format. When banked code was
	  moved to the CONST??? modules it didn't produce the correct
	  load address.

4.40		920217

	* UBROF version 5 is now acceptable as input (more external refs).

4.39		Not released

	* Corrected an annoying bug in HP-symbol format. Writing LINKER BY
	  JC/MF as file name sometimes.

4.38		911029
