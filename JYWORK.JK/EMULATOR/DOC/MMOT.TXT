Microtek Motorola S format implementation.

The FMMOT.DLL is used to load Motorola S fromat with Hitachi symbol extension
as implemented by Microtek's LNK180 linker. To support Microtek's implementation
following deviations are supported:

  - The S5 and S8 are not generated correctly (wrong checksum) and are therefore
    ignored. Since they convey no important information, this should induce no
    errors. A problem could occur when the S8 record would not report a zero
    load offset (should not occur on Zilog CPU). In this case the load offset
    must be manually set in the 'Download file options' dialog.

  - 'Symbol table' in the beginning of the file is read in as well. All symbols
    are put in the 'Assembler labels' group. This allows setting of fetch 
    breakpoints and watches (requires SW release 7.13b or higher) on these
    symbols.

Since the Motorola S file is a regular nondocument text file, its format can
not be safely detected, and is reported binary. User must override this by 
setting the file type to 'Other' and specifying the 'FMMOT.DLL' as the loader.
